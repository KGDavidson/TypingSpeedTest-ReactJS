I glared as I pushed the glass across the table."},{"paragraph":"If you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tall, with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the braincase of a man, you\'ll have a rough idea of what they looked like -- except for their teeth. The canines would have fitted better in the face of a tiger, and showed at the corners of their wide, thin-lipped mouths, giving them an expression of ferocity."},{"paragraph":"The trees, therefore, must be such old and primitive techniques that they thought nothing of them, deeming them so inconsequential that even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious. At that, they probably didn\'t have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land. And if that were true, there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden."},{"paragraph":"Turning away from the ledge, he started slowly down the mountain, deciding that he would, that very night, satisfy his curiosity about the man-house. In the meantime, he would go down into the canyon and get a cool drink, after which he would visit some berry patches just over the ridge, and explore among the foothills a bit before his nap-time, which always came just after the sun had walked past the middle of the sky. At that period of the day the sun\u2019s warm rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the silent mountainside, so all of the animals, with one accord, had decided it should be the hour for their mid-day sleep."},{"paragraph":"It went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness, and could not, for the life of him, tell whether he held the sheep right side up, or upside down. But that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself, who, with a sudden twist, jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust."},{"paragraph":"Since they are still preserved in the rocks for us to see, they must have been formed quite recently, that is, geologically speaking. What can explain these striations and their common orientation? Did you ever hear about the Great Ice Age or the Pleistocene Epoch? Less than one million years ago, in fact, some 12,000 years ago, an ice sheet many thousands of feet thick rode over Burke Mountain in a southeastward direction. The many boulders frozen to the underside of the ice sheet tended to scratch the rocks over which they rode. The scratches or striations seen in the park rocks were caused by these attached boulders. The ice sheet also plucked and rounded Burke Mountain into the shape it possesses today."},{"paragraph":"According to the caption on the bronze marker placed by the Multnomah Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution on May 12, 1939, \u201cCollege Hall (is) the oldest building in continuous use for Educational purposes west of the Rocky Mountains.

They were barely in time to see the huge gray form of the carnivore before it vanished behind a sign atop a nearby building which bore the mystifying information \'Pepsi-Cola.\'"},{"paragraph":"Out of another, I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate. There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least. He says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency. So I try."},{"paragraph":"Her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair. They were thick and almost horizontal, emphasizing the depth of her eyes. She was rather handsome than beautiful. Her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features. Her manner was engaging."},{"paragraph":"Indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness, filled her whole being with a vague anguish. It was like a shadow, like a mist passing across her soul\'s summer day. It was strange and unfamiliar; it was a mood. She did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband, lamenting at Fate, which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken. She was just having a good cry all to herself. The mosquitoes made merry over her, biting her firm, round arms and nipping at her bare insteps."},{"paragraph":"Then came the night of the first falling star. It was seen early in the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the atmosphere. Hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling star. It seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him."},{"paragraph":"I recollect that my first exploit in squirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one side of the valley. I had wandered into it at noontime, when all nature is peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar of my own gun, as it broke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes."},{"paragraph":"There wasn\'t a bird in the sky, but that was not what caught her attention. It was the clouds. The deep green that isn\'t the color of clouds, but came with these. She knew what was coming and she hoped she was prepared."},{"paragraph":"The boy walked down the street in a carefree way, playing without notice of what was about him. He didn\'t hear the sound of the car as his ball careened into the road. He took a step toward it, and in doing so sealed his fate."},{"paragraph":"The chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years. The only difference was there was someone actually sitting in it. How long had it been since someone had done that? Ten years or more he imagined. Yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now."},{"paragraph":"The red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox. It had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well. The other toys grumbled beneath. At one time each had held the spot of the red ball, but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box."},{"paragraph":"What were they eating? It didn\'t taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished, she didn\'t dare ask. She knew the answer would be one she didn\'t want to hear."},{"paragraph":"Sometimes that\'s just the way it has to be. Sure, there were probably other options, but he didn\'t let them enter his mind. It was done and that was that. It was just the way it had to be."},{"paragraph":"There was no time. He ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed for work, but it didn\'t matter. He was late and if he didn\'t make this meeting on time, someone\'s life may be in danger."},{"paragraph":"She tried not to judge him. His ratty clothes and unkempt hair made him look homeless. Was he really the next Einstein as she had been told? On the off chance it was true, she continued to try not to judge him."},{"paragraph":"He heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away. His heart started racing and he bolted into a full sprint. \'It wasn\'t a gunshot, it wasn\'t a gunshot,\' he repeated under his breathlessness as he continued to sprint."},{"paragraph":"Sometimes there isn\'t a good answer. No matter how you try to rationalize the outcome, it doesn\'t make sense. And instead of an answer, you are simply left with a question. Why?"},{"paragraph":"The computer wouldn\'t start. She banged on the side and tried again. Nothing. She lifted it up and dropped it to the table. Still nothing. She banged her closed fist against the top. It was at this moment she saw the irony of trying to fix the machine with violence."},{"paragraph":"What was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown. Both were curious, but only one was brave enough to want to explore. That was the problem. There was always one that let fear rule her life."},{"paragraph":"Eating raw fish didn\'t sound like a good idea. \'It\'s a delicacy in Japan,\' didn\'t seem to make it any more appetizing. Raw fish is raw fish, delicacy or not."},{"paragraph":"He couldn\'t move. His head throbbed and spun. He couldn\'t decide if it was the flu or the drinking last night. It was probably a combination of both."},{"paragraph":"Where do they get a random paragraph?\' he wondered as he clicked the generate button. Do they just write a random paragraph or do they get it somewhere? At that moment he read the random paragraph and realized it was about random paragraphs and his world would never be the same."},{"paragraph":"It was going to rain. The weather forecast didn\'t say that, but the steel plate in his hip did. He had learned over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman. It was going to rain, so he better get outside and prepare."},{"paragraph":"It was a weird concept. Why would I really need to generate a random paragraph? Could I actually learn something from doing so? All these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button. To her surprise, she found what she least expected to see."},{"paragraph":"It\'s always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn\'t have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn that day."},{"paragraph":"I\'m heading back to Colorado tomorrow after being down in Santa Barbara over the weekend for the festival there. I will be making October plans once there and will try to arrange so I\'m back here for the birthday if possible. I\'ll let you know as soon as I know the doctor\'s appointment schedule and my flight plans."},{"paragraph":"I\'ve rented a car in Las Vegas and have reserved a hotel in Twentynine Palms which is just north of Joshua Tree. We\'ll drive from Las Vegas through Mojave National Preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down. Then spend all day on Monday at Joshua Tree. We can decide the next morning if we want to do more in Joshua Tree or Mojave before we head back."},{"paragraph":"I haven\'t bailed on writing. Look, I\'m generating a random paragraph at this very moment in an attempt to get my writing back on track. I am making an effort. I will start writing consistently again!"},{"paragraph":"Don\'t be scared. The things out there that are unknown aren\'t scary in themselves. They are just unknown at the moment. Take the time to know them before you list them as scary. Then the world will be a much less scary place for you."},{"paragraph":"You can decide what you want to do in life, but I suggest doing something that creates. Something that leaves a tangible thing once you\'re done. That way even after you\'re gone, you will still live on in the things you created."},{"paragraph":"Do you think you\'re living an ordinary life? You are so mistaken it\'s difficult to even explain. The mere fact that you exist makes you extraordinary. The odds of you existing are less than winning the lottery, but here you are. Are you going to let this extraordinary opportunity pass?"},{"paragraph":"Cake or pie? I can tell a lot about you by which one you pick. It may seem silly, but cake people and pie people are really different. I know which one I hope you are, but that\'s not for me to decide. So, what is it? Cake or pie?"},{"paragraph":"What have you noticed today? I noticed that if you outline the eyes, nose, and mouth on your face with your finger, you make an \'I\' which makes perfect sense, but is something I never noticed before. What have you noticed today?"},{"paragraph":"She looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through. \'You need to learn to think for yourself,\' she wanted to tell him. \'Your friends are holding you back and bringing you down.\' But she didn\'t because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery, he would never give them up."},{"paragraph":"It was a question of which of the two she preferred. On the one hand, the choice seemed simple. The more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most. It was the easy choice. The safe choice. But she wasn\'t sure she actually preferred it."},{"paragraph":"Was it enough? That was the question he kept asking himself. Was being satisfied enough? He looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal. He knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasn\'t going to be enough."},{"paragraph":"Stranded. Yes, she was now the first person ever to land on Venus, but that was of little consequence. Her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here, but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her. She looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order. She was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last."},{"paragraph":"One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one\u2019s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas..."},{"paragraph":"She wondered if the note had reached him. She scolded herself for not handing it to him in person. She trusted her friend, but so much could happen. She waited impatiently for word."},{"paragraph":"He sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time. It wasn\'t. Had it been a hundred? It quite possibly could have been. Two hundred? Probably not. His mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time."},{"paragraph":"Colors bounced around in her head. They mixed and threaded themselves together. Even colors that had no business being together. They were all one, yet distinctly separate at the same time. How was she going to explain this to the others?"},{"paragraph":"He looked at the sand. Picking up a handful, he wondered how many grains were in his hand. Hundreds of thousands? \'Not enough,\' the said under his breath. I need more."},{"paragraph":"Things aren\'t going well at all with mom today. She is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all the time. I sure hope that things get better soon."},{"paragraph":"I\'m going to hire professional help tomorrow. I can\'t handle this anymore. She fell over the coffee table and now there is blood in her catheter. This is much more than I ever signed up to do."},{"paragraph":"Do you really listen when you are talking with someone? I have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way. She actually takes every word you say as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that, words take on a whole new meaning."},{"paragraph":"Here\'s the thing. She doesn\'t have anything to prove, but she is going to anyway. That\'s just her character. She knows she doesn\'t have to, but she still will just to show you that she can. Doubt her more and she\'ll prove she can again. We all already know this and you will too."},{"paragraph":"This is important to remember. Love isn\'t like pie. You don\'t need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones. No matter how much love you give, you can always give more. It doesn\'t run out, so don\'t try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out. Give it freely and as much as you want."},{"paragraph":"He wondered if he should disclose the truth to his friends. It would be a risky move. Yes, the truth would make things a lot easier if they all stayed on the same page, but the truth might fracture the group leaving everything in even more of a mess than it was not telling the truth. It was time to decide which way to go."},{"paragraph":"It was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life. While everyone around him was in tears and upset, he actually felt more at ease. The doctor said it would be less than a year. That gave him a year to live, something he\'d failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then."},{"paragraph":"Sitting in the sun, away from everyone who had done him harm in the past, he quietly listened to those who roamed by. He felt at peace in the moment, hoping it would last, but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end. He closed his eyes, the sun beating down on face and he smiled. He smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember."},{"paragraph":"She was in a hurry. Not the standard hurry when you\'re in a rush to get someplace, but a frantic hurry. The type of hurry where a few seconds could mean life or death. She raced down the road ignoring speed limits and weaving between cars. She was only a few minutes away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead."},{"paragraph":"Spending time at national parks can be an exciting adventure, but this wasn\'t the type of excitement she was hoping to experience. As she contemplated the situation she found herself in, she knew she\'d gotten herself in a little more than she bargained for. It wasn\'t often that she found herself in a tree staring down at a pack of wolves that were looking to make her their next meal."},{"paragraph":"Dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill, only a few miles from her house. The car had been hastily packed and Marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets. Dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldn\'t leave behind. He scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed. He continued to wait for Marta to appear with the pets, but she still was nowhere to be seen."},{"paragraph":"The words hadn\'t flowed from his fingers for the past few weeks. He never imagined he\'d find himself with writer\'s block, but here he sat with a blank screen in front of him. That blank screen taunting him day after day had started to play with his mind. He didn\'t understand why he couldn\'t even type a single word, just one to begin the process and build from there. And yet, he already knew that the eight hours he was prepared to sit in front of his computer today would end with the screen remaining blank."},{"paragraph":"I\'m meant to be writing at this moment. What I mean is, I\'m meant to be writing something else at this moment. The document I\'m meant to be writing is, of course, open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention. Yet here I am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because it\'s easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful. I am grateful for the distraction."},{"paragraph":"I guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase \'meant to be.\' That is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbo-jumbo. Maybe such a discussion would result in the determination that \'meant to be\' is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be, and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all. But that\'s my existential underpants underpinnings showing. It\'s the way the cookie crumbles. And now I want a cookie."},{"paragraph":"I recently discovered I could make fudge with just chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, vanilla extract, and a thick pot on slow heat. I tried it with dark chocolate chunks and I tried it with semi-sweet chocolate chips. It\'s better with both kinds. It comes out pretty bad with just the dark chocolate. The best add-ins are crushed almonds and marshmallows -- what you get from that is Rocky Road. It takes about twenty minutes from start to fridge, and then it takes about six months to work off the twenty pounds you gain from eating it. All things in moderation, friends. All things in moderation."},{"paragraph":"I inadvertently went to See\'s Candy last week (I was in the mall looking for phone repair), and as it turns out, See\'s Candy now charges a dollar -- a full dollar -- for even the simplest of their wee confection offerings. I bought two chocolate lollipops and two chocolate-caramel-almond things. The total cost was four-something. I mean, the candies were tasty and all, but let\'s be real: A Snickers bar is fifty cents. After this dollar-per-candy revelation, I may not find myself wandering dreamily back into a See\'s Candy any time soon."},{"paragraph":"Balloons are pretty and come in different colors, different shapes, different sizes, and they can even adjust sizes as needed. But don\'t make them too big or they might just pop, and then bye-bye balloon. It\'ll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind. They can serve a variety of purposes, from decorating to water balloon wars. You just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them."},{"paragraph":"Sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things don\'t work out as planned. This had been his life for the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it. He didn\'t actually enjoy it, but he had accepted it and come to terms with it. Or at least he thought he had. All that changed when he put the key into the ignition, turned it and the engine didn\'t make a sound."},{"paragraph":"There are only three ways to make this work. The first is to let me take care of everything. The second is for you to take care of everything. The third is to split everything 50 / 50. I think the last option is the most preferable, but I\'m certain it\'ll also mean the end of our marriage."},{"paragraph":"As she sat watching the world go by, something caught her eye. It wasn\'t so much its color or shape, but the way it was moving. She squinted to see if she could better understand what it was and where it was going, but it didn\'t help. As she continued to stare into the distance, she didn\'t understand why this uneasiness was building inside her body. She felt like she should get up and run. If only she could make out what it was. At that moment, she comprehended what it was and where it was heading, and she knew her life would never be the same."},{"paragraph":"It had been her dream for years but Dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true. There had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project. As she woke, she realized she was once again at a crossroads. Would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream? Dana rose and took her first step."},{"paragraph":"She nervously peered over the edge. She understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful, but all she felt was fear. There had always been something about heights that disturbed her, and now she could feel the full force of this unease. She reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build. She couldn\'t help but feel that something horrible was about to happen."},{"paragraph":"Greg understood that this situation would make Michael terribly uncomfortable. Michael simply had no idea what was about to come and even though Greg could prevent it from happening, he opted to let it happen. It was quite ironic, really. It was something Greg had said he would never wish upon anyone a million times, yet here he was knowingly letting it happen to one of his best friends. He rationalized that it would ultimately make Michael a better person and that no matter how uncomfortable, everyone should experience racism at least once in their lifetime."},{"paragraph":"The lone lamp post of the one-street town flickered, not quite dead but definitely on its way out. Suitcase by her side, she paid no heed to the light, the street or the town. A car was coming down the street and with her arm outstretched and thumb in the air, she had a plan."},{"paragraph":"He picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone. Day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate. He couldn\'t be sure. Day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion, but he knew it was a long time. Much too long."},{"paragraph":"At that moment he had a thought that he\'d never imagine he\'d consider. \'I could just cheat,\' he thought, \'and that would solve the problem.\' He tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent. It didn\'t want to go away and, if he was honest with himself, he didn\'t want it to."},{"paragraph":"Josh had spent year and year accumulating the information. He knew it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the field, Josh would be the one to call. The problem was that there was nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it. Years of information painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic."},{"paragraph":"There once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily bread. The old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around, and while he was gone the old woman, his wife, did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land."},{"paragraph":"The wave crashed and hit the sandcastle head-on. The sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded, half the sandcastle was gone. The next wave hit, not quite as strong, but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away. The third wave, a big one, crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it. When it receded, there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever."},{"paragraph":"Don\'t forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price. When you purchase a child the latest smartphone, you\'re also committing to a monthly phone bill. When you purchase the latest gaming system, you\'re likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play. When you buy gifts it\'s important to remember that some come with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself."},{"paragraph":"\'Are you getting my texts???\' she texted to him. He glanced at it and chuckled under his breath. Of course he was getting them, but if he wasn\'t getting them, how would he ever be able to answer? He put the phone down and continued on his project. He was ignoring her texts and he planned to continue to do so."},{"paragraph":"It\'s not his fault. I know you\'re going to want to, but you can\'t blame him. He really has no idea how it happened. I kept trying to come up with excuses I could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened, but the more I tried, the more I could see none of them would work. He was going to get her wrath and there was nothing I could say to prevent it."},{"paragraph":"They argue. While the argument seems to be different the truth is it\'s always the same. Yes, the topic may be different or the circumstances, but when all said and done, it all came back to the same thing. They both knew it, but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue. So they continue to argue."},{"paragraph":"He took a sip of the drink. He wasn\'t sure whether he liked it or not, but at this moment it didn\'t matter. She had made it especially for him so he would have forced it down even if he had absolutely hated it. That\'s simply the way things worked. She made him a new-fangled drink each day and he took a sip of it and smiled, saying it was excellent."},{"paragraph":"She patiently waited for his number to be called. She had no desire to be there, but her mom had insisted that she go. She\'s resisted at first, but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go. Mom tended to be that way. She would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted. So, here she sat, patiently waiting for her number to be called."},{"paragraph":"Green vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves toward the top of the canopy. Ants used the vine as their private highway, avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark, to freely move at top speed from top to bottom or bottom to top depending on their current chore. At least this was the way it was supposed to be. Something had damaged the vine overnight halfway up the tree leaving a gap in the once pristine ant highway."},{"paragraph":"It was just a burger. Why couldn\'t she understand that? She knew he\'d completely changed his life around her eating habits, so why couldn\'t she give him a break this one time? She wasn\'t even supposed to have found out. Yes, he had promised her and yes, he had broken that promise, but still in his mind, all it had been was just a burger."},{"paragraph":"He had three simple rules by which he lived. The first was to never eat blue food. There was nothing in nature that was edible that was blue. People often asked about blueberries, but everyone knows those are actually purple. He understood it was one of the stranger rules to live by, but it had served him well thus far in the 50+ years of his life."},{"paragraph":"The amber droplet hung from the branch, reaching fullness and ready to drop. It waited. While many of the other droplets were satisfied to form as big as they could and release, this droplet had other plans. It wanted to be part of history. It wanted to be remembered long after all the other droplets had dissolved into history. So it waited for the perfect specimen to fly by to trap and capture that it hoped would eventually be discovered hundreds of years in the future."},{"paragraph":"The cab arrived late. The inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning, and it didn\'t appear that it had been cleaned in months. The green tree air-freshener hanging from the rearview mirror was either exhausted of its scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from the cab. The correct decision, in this case, was to get the hell out of it and to call another cab, but she was late and didn\'t have a choice."},{"paragraph":"Hopes and dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn\'t and the hopes and dreams came crashing down."},{"paragraph":"The leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years. It wore those scars with pride, feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it. The scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty. The jacket was in its prime and it knew it."},{"paragraph":"The young man wanted a role model. He looked long and hard in his youth, but that role model never materialized. His only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didn\'t want to be like."},{"paragraph":"He had done everything right. There had been no mistakes throughout the entire process. It had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt, but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost."},{"paragraph":"She had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last. It was something that she carried within her in everything she did, but then he showed up and disrupted everything. He told her that she had it wrong. The first step wasn\'t the most important. The last step wasn\'t the most important. It was the next step that was the most important."},{"paragraph":"She didn\'t understand how changed worked. When she looked at today compared to yesterday, there was nothing that she could see that was different. Yet, when she looked at today compared to last year, she couldn\'t see how anything was ever the same."},{"paragraph":"It was a concerning development that he couldn\'t get out of his mind. He\'d had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them, but he couldn\'t understand how it had all stopped. There was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time, and he had no idea that it would be the last."},{"paragraph":"She looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen. She tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry. It hit her all at once. She was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear, sadness, and pride all running through her at the same time."},{"paragraph":"There was something special about this little creature. Donna couldn\'t quite pinpoint what it was, but she knew with all her heart that it was true. It wasn\'t a matter of if she was going to try and save it, but a matter of how she was going to save it. She went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned the creature was gone."},{"paragraph":"\'What is the best way to get what you want?\' she asked. He looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldn\'t like his answer. He hesitated, knowing that the truth would only hurt. How was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her?"},{"paragraph":"Dave found joy in the daily routine of life. He awoke at the same time, ate the same breakfast and drove the same commute. He worked at a job that never seemed to change and he got home at 6 pm sharp every night. It was who he had been for the last ten years and he had no idea that was all about to change."},{"paragraph":"There was something beautiful in his hate. It wasn\'t the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism and intolerance. It was what propelled the hate and the fact that although he had this hate, he didn\'t understand where it came from. It was at that moment that she realized that there was hope in changing him."},{"paragraph":"There were little things that she simply could not stand. The sound of someone tapping their nails on the table. A person chewing with their mouth open. Another human imposing themselves into her space. She couldn\'t stand any of these things, but none of them compared to the number one thing she couldn\'t stand which topped all of them combined."},{"paragraph":"There are different types of secrets. She had held onto plenty of them during her life, but this one was different. She found herself holding onto the worst type. It was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didn\'t tell someone about it, but it could end up getting you killed if you did."},{"paragraph":"MaryLou wore the tiara with pride. There was something that made doing anything she didn\'t really want to do a bit easier when she wore it. She really didn\'t care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment."},{"paragraph":"The day had begun on a bright note. The sun finally peeked through the rain for the first time in a week, and the birds were sinf=ging in its warmth. There was no way to anticipate what was about to happen. It was a worst-case scenario and there was no way out of it."},{"paragraph":"The red glint of paint sparkled under the sun. He had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten, and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago. It was his baby and he spent hours caring for it, pampering it, and fondling over it. She knew this all too well, and that\'s exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it."},{"paragraph":"His parents continued to question him. He didn\'t know what to say to them since they refused to believe the truth. He explained again and again, and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his imagination. There was no way that grandpa, who had been dead for five years, could have told him where the treasure had been hidden. Of course, it didn\'t help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the chair next to him as he tried to explain once again how he\'d found it."},{"paragraph":"\'Begin today!\' That\'s all the note said. There was no indication from where it came or who may have written it. Had it been meant for someone else? Meghan looked around the room, but nobody made eye contact back. For a brief moment, she thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams, but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she crumpled it up and threw it away."},{"paragraph":"He watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence. There was no doubt that he was smart. The fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced, but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence."},{"paragraph":"She sat in the darkened room waiting. It was now a standoff. He had the power to put her in the room, but not the power to make her repent. It wasn\'t fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness, she wouldn\'t change her attitude. At three years old, Sandy\'s stubborn personality had already bloomed into full view."},{"paragraph":"It was easy to spot her. All you needed to do was look at her socks. They were never a matching pair. One would be green while the other would be blue. One would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle. Every other part of her was perfect, but never the socks. They were her micro act of rebellion."},{"paragraph":"She had come to the conclusion that you could tell a lot about a person by their ears. The way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the person. Of course, she couldn\'t scientifically prove any of this, but that didn\'t matter to her. Before anything else, she would size up the ears of the person she was talking to."},{"paragraph":"Pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field. Cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river meandered off to the side. What looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy. Everything in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth."},{"paragraph":"The wolves stopped in their tracks, sizing up the mother and her cubs. It had been over a week since their last meal and they were getting desperate. The cubs would make a good meal, but there were high risks taking on the mother Grizzly. A decision had to be made and the wrong choice could signal the end of the pack."},{"paragraph":"She counted. One. She could hear the steps coming closer. Two. Puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth. Three. He stopped beside her. Four. She pulled the trigger of the gun."},{"paragraph":"All he could think about was how it would all end. There was still a bit of uncertainty in the equation, but the basics were there for anyone to see. No matter how much he tried to see the positive, it wasn\'t anywhere to be seen. The end was coming and it wasn\'t going to be pretty."},{"paragraph":"There was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming. In his youth, he sought adventure and the unknown, but that had been years ago. He wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless. That curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone."},{"paragraph":"He ordered his regular breakfast. Two eggs sunnyside up, hash browns, and two strips of bacon. He continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new. This was also part of the routine. A few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all. It was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years."},{"paragraph":"He knew what he was supposed to do. That had been apparent from the beginning. That was what made the choice so difficult. What he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same. This would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences, but he wasn\'t."},{"paragraph":"She tried to explain that love wasn\'t like pie. There wasn\'t a set number of slices to be given out. There wasn\'t less to be given to one person if you wanted to give more to another. That after a set amount was given out it would all disappear. She tried to explain this, but it fell on deaf ears."},{"paragraph":"Her mom had warned her. She had been warned time and again, but she had refused to believe her. She had done everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion. So when the promotion was given to her main rival, it not only stung, it threw her belief system into disarray. It was her first big lesson in life, but not the last."},{"paragraph":"They rushed out the door, grabbing anything and everything they could think of they might need. There was no time to double-check to make sure they weren\'t leaving something important behind. Everything was thrown into the car and they sped off. Thirty minutes later they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that they had forgotten the most important thing of all."},{"paragraph":"\'Explain to me again why I shouldn\'t cheat?\' he asked. \'All the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so. I should go about being happy losing to cheaters because I know that I don\'t? That\'s what you\'re telling me?\'"},{"paragraph":"Debbie put her hand into the hole, sliding her hand down as far as her arm could reach. She wiggled her fingers hoping to touch something, but all she felt was air. She shifted the weight of her body to try and reach an inch or two more down the hole. Her fingers still touched nothing but air."},{"paragraph":"She wanted rainbow hair. That\'s what she told the hairdresser. It should be deep rainbow colors, too. She wasn\'t interested in pastel rainbow hair. She wanted it deep and vibrant so there was no doubt that she had done this on purpose."},{"paragraph":"\'It was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing,\' he said. \'This is going to sound funny and a little strange, but you were in a dream I had just a couple of days ago. I\'d love to get together and tell you about it if you\'re up for a cup of coffee,\' he continued, laying the trap he\'d been planning for years."},{"paragraph":"It was a rat\'s nest. Not a literal one, but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up. It was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it. She peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it. It wasn\'t. She opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers."},{"paragraph":"Barbara had been waiting at the table for twenty minutes. it had been twenty long and excruciating minutes. David had promised that he would be on time today. He never was, but he had promised this one time. She had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week until she\'d believed his promise. Now she was paying the price."},{"paragraph":"You know that tingly feeling you get on the back of your neck sometimes? I just got that feeling when talking with her. You know I don\'t believe in sixth senses, but there is something not right with her. I don\'t know how I know, but I just do."},{"paragraph":"She asked the question even though she didn\'t really want to hear the answer. It was a no-win situation since she already knew. If he told the truth, she\'d get confirmation of her worst fears. If he lied, she\'d know that he wasn\'t who she thought he was which would be almost as bad. Yet she asked the question anyway and waited for his answer."},{"paragraph":"There was something in the tree. It was difficult to tell from the ground, but Rachael could see movement. She squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement, trying to decipher exactly what she had spied. The more she peered, however, the more she thought it might be a figment of her imagination. Nothing seemed to move until the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree. Then in the corner of her eye, she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again."},{"paragraph":"The headphones were on. They had been utilized on purpose. She could hear her mom yelling in the background, but couldn\'t make out exactly what the yelling was about. That was exactly why she had put them on. She knew her mom would enter her room at any minute, and she could pretend that she hadn\'t heard any of the previous yelling."},{"paragraph":"It wasn\'t quite yet time to panic. There was still time to salvage the situation. At least that is what she was telling himself. The reality was that it was time to panic and there wasn\'t time to salvage the situation, but he continued to delude himself into believing there was."},{"paragraph":"He was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate. He knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server ice-cream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time. It had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it. Nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement."},{"paragraph":"It was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed. You want to look, but you don\'t at the same time. You\'re frozen with fear and unable to act. That\'s where she found herself and she didn\'t know what to do next"},{"paragraph":"She considered the birds to be her friends. She\'d put out food for them each morning and then she\'d watch as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day. She wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her. Would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning?"},{"paragraph":"It seemed like it should have been so simple. There was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done. It was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time, but that wasn\'t the case. The deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished."},{"paragraph":"He heard the loud impact before he ever saw the result. It had been so loud that it had actually made him jump back in his seat. As soon as he recovered from the surprise, he saw the crack in the windshield. It seemed to be an analogy of the current condition of his life."},{"paragraph":"He sat staring at the person in the train stopped at the station going in the opposite direction. She sat staring ahead, never noticing that she was being watched. Both trains began to move and he knew that in another timeline or in another universe, they had been happy together."},{"paragraph":"She reached her goal, exhausted. Even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she thought she\'d feel upon reaching it wasn\'t there. Something wasn\'t right. Was this the only feeling she\'d have for over five years of hard work?"},{"paragraph":"She\'s asked the question so many times that she barely listened to the answers anymore. The answers were always the same. Well, not exactly the same, but the same in a general sense. A more accurate description was the answers never surprised her. So, she asked for the 10,000th time, \'What\'s your favorite animal?\' But this time was different. When she heard the young boy\'s answer, she wondered if she had heard him correctly."},{"paragraph":"Dave wasn\'t exactly sure how he had ended up in this predicament. He ran through all the events that had lead to this current situation and it still didn\'t make sense. He wanted to spend some time to try and make sense of it all, but he had higher priorities at the moment. The first was how to get out of his current situation of being naked in a tree with snow falling all around and no way for him to get down."},{"paragraph":"The alarm went off and Jake rose awake. Rising early had become a daily ritual, one that he could not fully explain. From the outside, it was a wonder that he was able to get up so early each morning for someone who had absolutely no plans to be productive during the entire day."},{"paragraph":"It had become a far too common an event in her life. She has specifically placed the key to the box in a special place so that she wouldn\'t lose it and know exactly where it was when the key was needed. Now that she needed to open the box, she had absolutely no idea where that special spot she placed the key might be."},{"paragraph":"It was difficult for him to admit he was wrong. He had been so certain that he was correct and the deeply held belief could never be shaken. Yet the proof that he had been incorrect stood right before his eyes. \'See daddy, I told you that they are real!\' his daughter excitedly proclaimed."},{"paragraph":"Waiting and watching. It was all she had done for the past weeks. When you\u2019re locked in a room with nothing but food and drink, that\u2019s about all you can do anyway. She watched as birds flew past the window bolted shut. She couldn\u2019t reach it if she wanted too, with that hole in the floor. She thought she could escape through it but three stories is a bit far down."},{"paragraph":"The box sat on the desk next to the computer. It had arrived earlier in the day and business had interrupted her opening it earlier. She didn\'t who had sent it and briefly wondered who it might have been. As she began to unwrap it, she had no idea that opening it would completely change her life."},{"paragraph":"Sometimes it\'s simply better to ignore the haters. That\'s the lesson that Tom\'s dad had been trying to teach him, but Tom still couldn\'t let it go. He latched onto them and their hate and couldn\'t let it go, but he also realized that this wasn\'t healthy. That\'s when he came up with his devious plan."},{"paragraph":"The rain and wind abruptly stopped, but the sky still had the gray swirls of storms in the distance. Dave knew this feeling all too well. The calm before the storm. He only had a limited amount of time before all Hell broke loose, but he stopped to admire the calmness. Maybe it would be different this time, he thought, with the knowledge deep within that it wouldn\'t."},{"paragraph":"She didn\'t like the food. She never did. She made the usual complaints and started the tantrum he knew was coming. But this time was different. Instead of trying to placate her and her unreasonable demands, he just stared at her and watched her meltdown without saying a word."},{"paragraph":"The shoes had been there for as long as anyone could remember. In fact, it was difficult for anyone to come up with a date they had first appeared. It had seemed they\'d always been there and yet they seemed so out of place. Why nobody had removed them was a question that had been asked time and again, but while they all thought it, nobody had ever found the energy to actually do it. So, the shoes remained on the steps, out of place in one sense, but perfectly normal in another."},{"paragraph":"Sometimes it\'s the first moment of the day that catches you off guard. That\'s what Wendy was thinking. She opened her window to see fire engines screeching down the street. While this wasn\'t something completely unheard of, it also wasn\'t normal. It was a sure sign of what was going to happen that day. She could feel it in her bones and it wasn\'t the way she wanted the day to begin."},{"paragraph":"She had been an angel for coming up on 10 years and in all that time nobody had told her this was possible. The fact that it could ever happen never even entered her mind. Yet there she stood, with the undeniable evidence sitting on the ground before her. Angels could lose their wings."},{"paragraph":"The spot was perfect for camouflage. At least that\'s what she thought when she picked the spot. She couldn\'t imagine that anyone would ever be able to see her in these surroundings. So there she sat, confident that she was hidden from the world and safe from danger. Unfortunately, she had not anticipated that others may be looking upon her from other angles, and now they were stealthily descending toward her hiding spot."},{"paragraph":"There was little doubt that the bridge was unsafe. All one had to do was look at it to know that with certainty. Yet Bob didn\'t see another option. He may have been able to work one out if he had a bit of time to think things through, but time was something he didn\'t have. A choice needed to be made, and it needed to be made quickly."},{"paragraph":"He walked down the steps from the train station in a bit of a hurry knowing the secrets in the briefcase must be secured as quickly as possible. Bounding down the steps, he heard something behind him and quickly turned in a panic. There was nobody there but a pair of old worn-out shoes were placed neatly on the steps he had just come down. Had he past them without seeing them? It didn\'t seem possible. He was about to turn and be on his way when a deep chill filled his body."},{"paragraph":"He was aware there were numerous wonders of this world including the unexplained creations of humankind that showed the wonder of our ingenuity. There are huge heads on Easter Island. There are the Egyptian pyramids. There\u2019s Stonehenge. But he now stood in front of a newly discovered monument that simply didn\'t make any sense and he wondered how he was ever going to be able to explain it."},{"paragraph":"It was a scrape that he hardly noticed. Sure, there was a bit of blood but it was minor compared to most of the other cuts and bruises he acquired on his adventures. There was no way he could know that the rock that produced the cut had alien genetic material on it that was now racing through his bloodstream. He felt perfectly normal and continued his adventure with no knowledge of what was about to happen to him."},{"paragraph":"She never liked cleaning the sink. It was beyond her comprehension how it got so dirty so quickly. It seemed that she was forced to clean it every other day. Even when she was extra careful to keep things clean and orderly, it still ended up looking like a mess in a couple of days. What she didn\'t know was there was a tiny creature living in it that didn\'t like things neat."},{"paragraph":"It was their first date and she had been looking forward to it the entire week. She had her eyes on him for months, and it had taken a convoluted scheme with several friends to make it happen, but he\'d finally taken the hint and asked her out. After all the time and effort she\'d invested into it, she never thought that it would be anything but wonderful. It goes without saying that things didn\'t work out quite as she expected."},{"paragraph":"Many people say that life isn\'t like a bed of roses. I beg to differ. I think that life is quite like a bed of roses. Just like life, a bed of roses looks pretty on the outside, but when you\'re in it, you find that it is nothing but thorns and pain. I myself have been pricked quite badly."},{"paragraph":"It really didn\'t matter what they did to him. He\'s already made up his mind. Whatever came his way, he was prepared for the consequences. He knew in his heart that the sacrifice he made was done with love and not hate no matter how others decided to spin it."},{"paragraph":"There was a reason for her shyness. Everyone assumed it had always been there but she knew better. She knew the exact moment that the shyness began. It had been that fateful moment at the lake. There are just some events that do that to you."},{"paragraph":"She closed her eyes and then opened them again. What she was seeing just didn\'t make sense. She shook her head seeing if that would help. It didn\'t. Although it seemed beyond reality, there was no denying she was witnessing a large formation of alien spaceships filling the sky."},{"paragraph":"Sometimes it\'s just better not to be seen. That\'s how Harry had always lived his life. He prided himself as being the fly on the wall and the fae that blended into the crowd. That\'s why he was so shocked that she noticed him."},{"paragraph":"There was nothing else to do. The deed had already been done and there was no going back. It now had been become a question of how they were going to be able to get out of this situation and escape."},{"paragraph":"The song came from the bathroom belting over the sound of the shower\'s running water. It was the same way each day began since he could remember. It listened intently and concluded that the singing today was as terrible as it had ever been."},{"paragraph":"They say you only come to peace with yourself when you know yourself better than those around you. Derick knew nothing about this. He thought he had found peace but this was an illusion as he was about to find out with an unexpected occurrence that he actually knew nothing about himself."},{"paragraph":"There was only one way to do things in the Statton house. That one way was to do exactly what the father, Charlie, demanded. He made the decisions and everyone else followed without question. That was until today."},{"paragraph":"Twenty-five years Dana had been waiting. She tried to be patient during that time but she hadn\'t always managed to be as patient as she\'d like. But today the opportunity had finally come. The thing she always imagined would make her the happiest person in the world was about to happen. She didn\'t know why at this specific time she all of a sudden felt sick inside."},{"paragraph":"Ten more steps. If he could take ten more steps it would be over, but his legs wouldn\'t move. He tried to will them to work, but they wouldn\'t listen to his brain. Ten more steps and it would be over but it didn\'t appear he would be able to do it."},{"paragraph":"It was a simple tip of the hat. Grace didn\'t think that anyone else besides her had even noticed it. It wasn\'t anything that the average person would notice, let alone remember at the end of the day. That\'s why it seemed so unbelievable that this little gesture would ultimately change the course of the world."},{"paragraph":"They had always called it the green river. It made sense. The river was green. The river likely had a different official name, but to everyone in town, it was and had always been the green river. So it was with great surprise that on this day the green river was a fluorescent pink."},{"paragraph":"It all started with the computer. Had he known what was to follow, he would have never logged on that day. But the truth was there was no way to know what was about to happen. So Dave pressed the start button, the computer booted up, the screen came alive, and everything Dave knew to be true no longer was."},{"paragraph":"\'It doesn\'t take much to touch someone\'s heart,\' Daisy said with a smile on her face. \'It\'s often just the little things you do that can change a person\'s day for the better.\' Daisy truly believed this to be the way the world worked, but she didn\'t understand that she was merely a robot that had been programmed to believe this."},{"paragraph":"There were only two ways to get out of this mess if they all worked together. The problem was that neither was all that appealing. One would likely cause everyone a huge amount of physical pain while the other would likely end up with everyone in jail. In Sam\'s mind, there was only one thing to do. He threw everyone else under the bus and he secretly sprinted away leaving the others to take the fall without him."},{"paragraph":"There was only half a worm in the apple. At first, Judy didn\'t quite comprehend what this meant. \'Why would only half a worm be living in an apple?\' she wondered. And then it dawned on her. Judy quickly spit out the bite she had just taken expecting to see the other half of the worm. It ended up being much worse than that."},{"paragraph":"She needed glasses. It wasn\'t that she couldn\'t see without them, but what she could see with them. When she wore glasses, her eyes focused so deeply that she could see not only the physical but also beyond. It was like a superpower. But she needed glasses."},{"paragraph":"The clowns had taken over. And yes, they were literally clowns. Over 100 had appeared out of a small VW bug that had been driven up to the bank. Now they were all inside and had taken it over."},{"paragraph":"She glanced up into the sky to watch the clouds taking shape. First, she saw a dog. Next, it was an elephant. Finally, she saw a giant umbrella and at that moment the rain began to pour."},{"paragraph":"She sat deep in thought. The next word that came out o her mouth would likely be the most important word of her life. It had to be exact with no possibility of being misinterpreted. She was ready. She looked deeply into his eyes and said, \'Octopus.\'"},{"paragraph":"Benny was tired. Not the normal every day tired from a hard day o work. The exhausted type of tired where you\'re surprised your body can even move. All he wanted to do was sit in front of the TV, put his feet up on the coffee table, and drink a beer. The only issue was that he had forgotten where he lived."},{"paragraph":"Terrance knew that sometimes it was simply best to stay out of it. He kept repeating this to himself as he watched the scene unfold. He knew that nothing good would come of him getting involved. It was far better for him to stay on the sidelines and observe. He kept yelling this to himself inside his head as he walked over to the couple and punched the man in the face."},{"paragraph":"Finding the truth wouldn\'t be easy, that\'s for sure. Then there was the question of whether or not Jane really wanted to know the truth. That\'s the thing that bothered her most. It wasn\'t the difficulty of actually finding out what happened that was the obstacle, but having to live with that information once it was found."},{"paragraph":"The wave roared towards them with speed and violence they had not anticipated. They both turned to run but by that time it was too late. The wave crashed into their legs sweeping both of them off of their feet. They now found themselves in a washing machine of saltwater, getting tumbled and not know what was up or down. Both were scared, not knowing how this was going to end, but it was by far the best time of the trip thus far."},{"paragraph":"The light was out on the front porch of the house. This was strange. Judy couldn\'t remember a time when she had ever seen it out. She hopped out of her car and walked to the door. It was slightly ajar and she knew this meant something terrible. She gently pushed the door open and hall her fears were realized. \'Surprise! Happy Birthday!\' everyone shouted."},{"paragraph":"It wasn\'t supposed to end that way. The plan had been meticulously thought out and practiced again and again. There was only one possible result once it had been implemented, but as they stood there the result wasn\'t anything close to what it should have been. They all blankly looked at each wondering how this could have happened. In their minds, they all began to blame the other members of the group as to why they had failed."},{"paragraph":"Samantha wanted to be famous. The problem was that she had never considered all the downsides to actually being famous. Had she taken the time to objectively consider these downsides, she would have never agreed to publically sing that first song."},{"paragraph":"Twenty seconds were all that was left and Richard could hear each one tick by. Fifteen seconds now remained and the panic began to fully set in. Ten seconds and he wasn\'t sure he had enough time. Five seconds, four, three, two, one..."},{"paragraph":"The coin hovered in the air, spinning over and over again. It reached its peak and began to descend. Both boys were pleading with it to land a certain way but the coin had already made up its mind on what it was going to do."},{"paragraph":"The house was located at the top of the hill at the end of a winding road. It wasn\'t obvious that the house was there, but everyone in town knew that it existed. They were just all too afraid to ever go and see it in person."},{"paragraph":"He swung back the fishing pole and cast the line which ell 25 feet away into the river. The lure landed in the perfect spot and he was sure he would soon get a bite. He never expected that the bite would come from behind in the form of a bear."},{"paragraph":"Sometimes it just doesn\'t make sense. The man walking down the street in a banana suit. The llama standing in the middle of the road. The fairies dancing in front of the car window. The fact that all of this was actually happening and wasn\'t a dream."},{"paragraph":"He couldn\'t remember exactly where he had read it, but he was sure that he had. The fact that she didn\'t believe him was quite frustrating as he began to search the Internet to find the article. It wasn\'t as if it was something that seemed impossible. Yet she insisted on always seeing the source whenever he stated a fact."},{"paragraph":"Dragons don\'t exist they said. They are the stuff of legend and people\'s imagination. Greg would have agreed with this assessment without a second thought 24 hours ago. But now that there was a dragon staring directly into his eyes, he questioned everything that he had been told."},{"paragraph":"The choice was red, green, or blue. It didn\'t seem like an important choice when he was making it, but it was a choice nonetheless. Had he known the consequences at that time, he would likely have considered the choice a bit longer. In the end, he didn\'t and ended up choosing blue."},{"paragraph":"Debbie had taken George for granted for more than fifteen years now. He wasn\'t sure what exactly had made him choose this time and place to address the issue, but he decided that now was the time. He looked straight into her eyes and just as she was about to speak, turned away and walked out the door."},{"paragraph":"There was nothing to indicate Nancy was going to change the world. She looked like an average girl going to an average high school. It was the fact that everything about her seemed average that would end up becoming her superpower."},{"paragraph":"All he wanted was a candy bar. It didn\'t seem like a difficult request to comprehend, but the clerk remained frozen and didn\'t seem to want to honor the request. It might have had something to do with the gun pointed at his face."},{"paragraph":"There wasn\'t a whole lot more that could be done. It had become a wait-and-see situation with the final results no longer in her control. That didn\'t stop her from trying to control the situation. She demanded that things be done as she desperately tried to control what couldn\'t be."},{"paragraph":"They had made it to Las Vegas, wide-eyed and with so much hope and energy. They had planned the trip for more than a year and both were so excited they could barely control themselves. They still hadn\'t realized that Las Vegas promised a place where dreams come true, it was actually the place where dreams came to die."},{"paragraph":"She was aware that things could go wrong. In fact, she had trained her entire life in anticipation that things would go wrong one day. She had quiet confidence as she started to see that this was the day that all her training would be worthwhile and useful. At this point, she had no idea just how wrong everything would go that day."},{"paragraph":"Debbie knew she was being selfish and unreasonable. She understood why the others in the room were angry and frustrated with her and the way she was acting. In her eyes, it didn\'t really matter how they felt because she simply didn\'t care."},{"paragraph":"It probably seemed trivial to most people, but it mattered to Tracey. She wasn\'t sure why it mattered so much to her, but she understood deep within her being that it mattered to her. So for the 365th day in a row, Tracey sat down to eat pancakes for breakfast."},{"paragraph":"Time is all relative based on age and experience. When you are a child an hour is a long time to wait but a very short time when that\u2019s all the time you are allowed on your iPad. As a teenager time goes faster the more deadlines you have and the more you procrastinate. As a young adult, you think you have forever to live and don\u2019t appreciate the time you spend with others. As a middle-aged adult, time flies by as you watch your children grow up. And finally, as you get old and you have fewer responsibilities and fewer demands on you, time slows. You appreciate each day and are thankful you are alive. An hour is the same amount of time for everyone yet it can feel so different in how it goes by."},{"paragraph":"Have you ever wondered about toes? Why 10 toes and not 12. Why are some bigger than others? Some people can use their toes to pick up things while others can barely move them on command. Some toes are nice to look at while others are definitely not something you want to look at. Toes can be stubbed and make us scream. Toes help us balance and walk. 10 toes are just something to ponder."},{"paragraph":"Stormi is a dog. She is dark grey and has long legs. Her eyes are expressive and are able to let her humans know what she is thinking. Her tongue is long, pink, and wet. Her long legs allow her to sprint after other dogs, people or bunnies. She can be a good dog, but also very bad. Her tail wags when happy or excited and hides between her back legs when she is bad. Stormi is a dog I love."},{"paragraph":"I love the feel of wood curls flying off the lathe as I begin to shape the log in front of me. The sound of scraping changes based on the wetness of the wood, the speed at which the lathe is turning, and the type of cut I am making. The smell and feel of wet wood being turned are unique. The water is sprayed out as I cut through the different layers of wood. A log can turn into anything one\'s imagination can think of with the right set of hands-on tools. I have those hands and imagination. I use all of my senses and intuition to create a beautiful object. That is why I enjoy turning wood."},{"paragraph":"Another option you have is choosing the number of syllables in the words you speak. You probably have never considered this option before, but you have it every time you open your mouth and speak. You make so many choices like this that you never even think about, but you have the choice with each one. What are you going to do with this knowledge?"},{"paragraph":"The opened package of potato chips held the answer to the mystery. Both detectives looked at it but failed to realize it was the key to solve the crime. They passed by it assuming it was random trash ensuring that the case would never be solved."},{"paragraph":"The headache wouldn\'t go away. She\'s taken medicine but even that didn\'t help. The monstrous throbbing in her head continued. She had this happen to her only once before in her life and she realized that only one thing could be happening."},{"paragraph":"\'It\'s never good to give them details,\' Janice told her sister. \'Always be a little vague and keep them guessing.\' Her sister listened intently and nodded in agreement. She didn\'t fully understand what her sister was saying but that didn\'t matter. She loved her so much that she would have agreed to whatever came out of her mouth."},{"paragraph":"Her breath exited her mouth in big puffs as if she were smoking a cigarette. The morning dew had made her clothes damp and she shivered from the chill in the air. There was only one thing that could get her up and out this early in the morning."},{"paragraph":"Betty was a creature of habit and she thought she liked it that way. That was until Dave showed up in her life. She now had a choice to make and it would determine whether her lie remained the same or if it would change forever."},{"paragraph":"She has seen this scene before. It had come to her in dreams many times before. She had to pinch herself to make sure it wasn\'t a dream again. As her fingers squeezed against her arm, she felt the pain. It was this pain that immediately woke her up."},{"paragraph":"It had been a simple realization that had changed Debra\'s life perspective. It was really so simple that she was embarrassed that she had lived the previous five years with the way she measured her worth. Now that she saw what she had been doing, she could see how sad it was. That made her all the more relieved she had made the change. The number of hearts her Instagram posts received wasn\'t any longer the indication of her own self-worth."},{"paragraph":"Matt told her to reach for the stars, but Veronica thought it was the most ridiculous advice she\'d ever received. Sure, it had been well-meaning when he said it, but she didn\'t understand why anyone would want to suggest something that would literally kill you if you actually managed to achieve it."},{"paragraph":"Peter always saw the world in black and white. There were two choices for every situation and you had to choose one of them. It was therefore terribly uncomfortable for him to spend time with Ashley. She saw the world in shades of gray with hundreds of choices to choose from in every situation."},{"paragraph":"At that moment, she realized that she had created her current life. It wasn\'t the life she wanted, but she took responsibility for how it currently stood. Something clicked and she saw that every choice she made to this point in her life had led to where her life stood at this very moment even if she knew this wasn\'t where she wanted to be. She determined to choose to change it."},{"paragraph":"She had a terrible habit o comparing her life to others. She realized that their life experiences were completely different than her own and that she saw only what they wanted her to see, but that didn\'t matter. She still compared herself and yearned for what she thought they had and she didn\'t."},{"paragraph":"Bryan had made peace with himself and felt comfortable with the choices he made. This had made all the difference in the world. Being alone no longer bothered him and this was essential since there was a good chance he might spend the rest of his life alone in a cell."},{"paragraph":"He lifted the bottle to his lips and took a sip of the drink. He had tasted this before, but he couldn\'t quite remember the time and place it had happened. He desperately searched his mind trying to locate and remember where he had tasted this when the bicycle ran over his foot."},{"paragraph":"His mother had always taught him not to ever think of himself as better than others. He\'d tried to live by this motto. He never looked down on those who were less fortunate or who had less money than him. But the stupidity of the group of people he was talking to made him change his mind."},{"paragraph":"Welcome to my world. You will be greeted by the unexpected here and your mind will be challenged and expanded in ways that you never thought possible. That is if you are able to survive..."},{"paragraph":"You\'re going to make a choice today that will have a direct impact on where you are five years from now. The truth is, you\'ll make choice like that every day of your life. The problem is that on most days, you won\'t know the choice you make will have such a huge impact on your life in the future. So if you want to end up in a certain place in the future, you need to be careful of the choices you make today."},{"paragraph":"April seriously wondered about her sleeping partner choices. She looked at her bed and what a mess it had become. How did she get to the point in her life where she had two dogs, three cats, and a raccoon sleeping with her every night?"},{"paragraph":"The boxed moved. That was a problem. Peter had packed the box three hours before and there was nothing inside that should make it move. The question now was whether or not Peter was going to open it up and look inside to see why it had moved. The answer to that question was obvious. Peter dropped the package into the mailbox so he would never have to see it again."},{"paragraph":"After hunting for several hours, we finally saw a large seal sunning itself on a flat rock. I took one of the wooden clubs while Larry took the longer one. We slowly snuck up behind the seal until we were close enough to club it over its head. The seal slumped over and died. This seal would help us survive. We could eat the meat and fat. The fat could be burned in a shell for light and the fur could be used to make a blanket. We declared our first day of hunting a great success."},{"paragraph":"One can cook on and with an open fire. These are some of the ways to cook with fire outside. Cooking meat using a spit is a great way to evenly cook meat. In order to keep meat from burning, it\'s best to slowly rotate it. Hot stones can be used to toast bread. Coals are hot and can bring things to a boil quickly. If one is very adventurous, one can make a hole in the ground, fill it with coals and place foil-covered meat, veggies, and potatoes into the coals, and cover all of it with dirt. In a short period of time, the food will be baked. Campfire cooking can be done in many ways."},{"paragraph":"Puppies are soft, cute, funny, and make a big mess. Every month or two our family fosters 6-12 week old puppies for a puppy rescue nonprofit organization. We all enjoy cuddling their furry bodies after a clean bath. Fresh puppy smell is great. The puppies play with each other and our adult dog. They look so funny when they lay on top of each other and sleep. While puppies can be great fun, they also can make big messes. 4-6 puppies can make a lot of puppy pee and poop. It\'s a challenge to keep the puppies and the puppy pen clean."},{"paragraph":"She sat down with her notebook in her hand, her mind wandering to faraway places. She paused and considered all that had happened. It hadn\'t gone as expected. When the day began she thought it was going to be a bad one, but as she sat recalling the day\'s events to write them down, she had to admit, it had been a rather marvelous day."},{"paragraph":"He stepped away from the mic. This was the best take he had done so far, but something seemed missing. Then it struck him all at once. Visuals ran in front of his eyes and music rang in his ears. His eager fingers went to work in an attempt to capture his thoughts hoping the results would produce something that was at least half their glory."},{"paragraph":"The paper was blank. It shouldn\'t have been. There should have been writing on the paper, at least a paragraph if not more. The fact that the writing wasn\'t there was frustrating. Actually, it was even more than frustrating. It was downright distressing."},{"paragraph":"Twenty-five stars were neatly placed on the piece of paper. There was room for five more stars but they would be difficult ones to earn. It had taken years to earn the first twenty-five, and they were considered the \'easy\' ones."},{"paragraph":"He collected the plastic trash on a daily basis. It never seemed to end. Even if he cleaned the entire beach, more plastic would cover it the next day after the tide had come in. Although it was a futile effort that would never be done, he continued to pick up the trash each day."},{"paragraph":"The blinking light caught her attention. She thought about it a bit and couldn\'t remember ever noticing it before. That was strange since it was obvious the flashing light had been there for years. Now she wondered how she missed it for that amount of time and what other things in her small town she had failed to notice."},{"paragraph":"Love isn\'t always a ray of sunshine. That\'s what the older girls kept telling her when she said she had found the perfect man. She had thought this was simply bitter talk on their part since they had been unable to find true love like hers. But now she had to face the fact that they may have been right. Love may not always be a ray of sunshine. That is unless they were referring to how the sun can burn."},{"paragraph":"The towels had been hanging from the rod for years. They were stained and worn, and quite frankly, just plain ugly. Debra didn\'t want to touch them but she really didn\'t have a choice. It was important for her to see what was living within them."},{"paragraph":"The bush began to shake. Brad couldn\'t see what was causing it to shake, but he didn\'t care. he had a pretty good idea about what was going on and what was happening. He was so confident that he approached the bush carefree and with a smile on his face. That all changed the instant he realized what was actually behind the bush."},{"paragraph":"The red line moved across the page. With each millimeter it advanced forward, something changed in the room. The actual change taking place was difficult to perceive, but the change was real. The red line continued relentlessly across the page and the room would never be the same."},{"paragraph":"I\'m so confused by your ridiculous meltdown that I must insist on some sort of explanation for your behavior towards me. It just doesn\'t make any sense. There\'s no way that I deserved the treatment you gave me without an explanation or an apology for how out of line you have been."},{"paragraph":"It\'s an unfortunate reality that we don\'t teach people how to make money (beyond getting a 9 to 5 job) as part of our education system. The truth is there are a lot of different, legitimate ways to make money. That doesn\'t mean they are easy and that you won\'t have to work hard to succeed, but it does mean that if you\'re willing to open your mind a bit you don\'t have to be stuck in an office from 9 to 5 for the next fifty years o your life."},{"paragraph":"\'I\'ll talk to you tomorrow in more detail at our meeting, but I think I\'ve found a solution to our problem. It\'s not exactly legal, but it won\'t land us in jail for the rest of our lives either. Are you willing to take the chance?\' Monroe asked his partner over the phone."},{"paragraph":"The thing that\'s great about this job is the time sourcing the items involves no traveling. I just look online to buy it. It\'s really as simple as that. While everyone else is searching for what they can sell, I sit in front of my computer and buy better stuff for less money and spend a fraction of the time doing it."},{"paragraph":"Patricia\'s friend who was here hardly had any issues at all, but she wasn\'t telling the truth. Yesterday, before she left to go home, she heard that her husband is in the hospital and pretended to be surprised. It later came out that she was the person who had put him there."},{"paragraph":"Trees. It was something about the trees. The way they swayed with the wind in unison. The way they shaded the area around them. The sounds of their leaves in the wind and the creaks from the branches as they sway, The trees were making a statement that I just couldn\'t understand."},{"paragraph":"The river slowly meandered through the open space. It had hidden secrets that it didn\'t want to reveal. It had a well-planned strategy to appear calm, inviting, and appealing. That\'s how the river lured her unknowing victims to her water\'s edge."},{"paragraph":"He wandered down the stairs and into the basement. The damp, musty smell of unuse hung in the air. A single, small window let in a glimmer of light, but this simply made the shadows in the basement deeper. He inhaled deeply and looked around at a mess that had been accumulating for over 25 years. He was positive that this was the place he wanted to live."},{"paragraph":"My pincher collar is snapped on. Then comes the electric zapper collar. Finally, my purple at-home collar is taken off and I know I\u2019m going for a walk to the dog park. I\u2019m so excited to see my friends. I hope Spike or Thunder are there already. They\'re the most fun to chase and tumble with. My human is pretty strict with me. I\u2019m only allowed on the grass and not on the sidewalks. I think she\u2019s afraid I\u2019m going to jump on the other humans. I don\u2019t understand why everyone else gets to jump on the benches and run wild on the sidewalks. They don\u2019t listen to their humans. I know I could ignore mine but if I do she may zap me and it\u2019s just not worth it. She probably wouldn\u2019t let me back at the dog park if I didn\u2019t listen to her. I just love the dog park."},{"paragraph":"Housework could be everyone\u2019s work, not just \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d. Why do women enable men to act oblivious to cleaning, grocery shopping, pet feeding, etc? Somehow when men live alone they figure out how to do all of those things all on their own. My friend\u2019s husband claimed he didn\u2019t know that sheets should be washed more than once a season. He said he didn\u2019t know one had to clean toilets. He assumed that since you flush toilets they clean themselves. She tried to get him to help but he did an awful job so she let him off the hook. Wouldn\u2019t it be better if she spent the time and energy to get him to do it right instead of letting him claim he is \u201cjust bad at it\u201d. My sons were raised to clean toilets and change their own sheets. Hopefully, in their future homes, the housework will be equally divided."},{"paragraph":"I don\u2019t like cats and they don\u2019t like me. I used to be allergic to them and I would get stuffed up and have hives. That doesn\u2019t seem to happen anymore. But I still don\u2019t like them. I lived with 3 cats that were not good at peeing in the litter box. They seemed to find something important to me and pee on it. Most of the time they peed on photographs or papers that would be ruined. Cats also bring fleas into the house. There is nothing worse than having to flea dip cats and also flea bomb a home. That is why I don\u2019t like cats."},{"paragraph":"Sleep deprivation causes all sorts of challenges and problems. When one doesn\u2019t get enough sleep one\u2019s mind doesn\u2019t work clearly. Studies have shown that after staying awake for 24 hours one\u2019s ability to do simple math is greatly impaired. Driving tired has been shown to be as bad as driving drunk. Moods change, depression, anxiety, and mania can be induced by lack of sleep. As much as people try to do without enough sleep it is a wonder more crazy things don\u2019t happen in this world."},{"paragraph":"Breastfeeding is good for babies and moms. Infants that are breastfed get antibodies from their mothers against common illnesses. Breastfed babies have less chance of being obese as an adult. Breastfeeding a baby lets the infant-mother pair bond in a very unique way. Mother\u2019s who breastfeed lower their chances of developing breast cancer. Usually, mothers who breastfeed lose their pregnancy weight more quickly and easily. The benefits of breastfeeding are numerous."},{"paragraph":"Why do Americans have so many different types of towels? We have beach towels, hand towels, bath towels, dish towels, camping towels, quick-dry towels, and let\u2019s not forget paper towels. Would 1 type of towel work for each of these things? Let\u2019s take a beach towel. It can be used to dry your hands and body with no difficulty. A beach towel could be used to dry dishes. Just think how many dishes you could dry with one beach towel. I\u2019ve used a beach towel with no adverse effects while camping. If you buy a thin beach towel it can dry quickly too. I\u2019d probably cut up a beach towel to wipe down counters or for cleaning other items, but a full beach towel could be used too. Is having so many types of towels an extravagant luxury that Americans enjoy or is it necessary? I\u2019d say it\'s overkill and we could cut down on the many types of towels that manufacturers deem necessary."},{"paragraph":"He slowly poured the drink over a large chunk of ice he has especially chiseled off a larger block. He didn\'t particularly like his drinks cold, but he knew that the drama of chiseling the ice and then pouring a drink over it looked far more impressive than how he actually liked it. It was all about image and he\'d managed to perfect the image that he wanted to project."},{"paragraph":"It really shouldn\'t have mattered to Betty. That\'s what she kept trying to convince herself even if she knew it mattered to Betty more than practically anything else. Why was she trying to convince herself otherwise? As she stepped forward to knock on Betty\'s door, she still didn\'t have a convincing answer to this question that she\'d been asking herself for more than two years now."},{"paragraph":"He dropped the ball. While most people would think that this was a metaphor of some type, in Joe\'s case it was absolutely literal. He had hopes of reaching the Major League and that dream was now it great jeopardy. All because he had dropped the ball."},{"paragraph":"It was hidden under the log beside the stream. It had been there for as long as Jerry had been alive. He wasn\'t sure if anyone besides him and his friends knew of its existence. He knew that anyone could potentially find it, but it was well enough hidden that it seemed unlikely to happen. The fact that it had been there for more than 30 years attested to this. So it was quite a surprise when he found the item was missing."},{"paragraph":"There was something in the sky. What exactly was up there wasn\'t immediately clear. But there was definitely something in the sky and it was getting bigger and bigger."},{"paragraph":"The picket fence had stood for years without any issue. That\'s all it was. A simple, white, picket fence. Why it had all of a sudden become a lightning rod within the community was still unbelievable to most. Yet a community that had once lived in harmony was now divided in bitter hatred and it had everything to do with the white picket fence."},{"paragraph":"The alarm went off at exactly 6:00 AM as it had every morning for the past five years. Barbara began her morning and was ready to eat breakfast by 7:00 AM. The day appeared to be as normal as any other, but that was about to change. In fact, it was going to change at exactly 7:23 AM."},{"paragraph":"\'Do Not Enter.\' The sign made it clear that they didn\'t want anyone around. That wasn\'t going to stop Jack. Jack always lived with the notion that signs were mere suggestions, not actually absolute rules. That\'s why the moment Jack looked at the \'Do Not Enter\' sign, he walked past it and onto their property."},{"paragraph":"There were two things that were important to Tracey. The first was her dog. Anyone that had ever met Tracey knew how much she loved her dog. Most would say that she treated it as her child. The dog went everywhere with her and it had been her best friend for the past five years. The second thing that was important to Tracey, however, would be a lot more surprising to most people."},{"paragraph":"There were about twenty people on the dam. Most of them were simply walking and getting exercise. There were a few who were fishing. There was a family who had laid down a blanket and they were having a picnic. It was like this most days and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. The problem was that nobody noticed the water leaking through the dam wall."},{"paragraph":"Should he write it down? That was the question running through his mind. He couldn\'t believe what had just happened and he knew nobody else would believe him as well. Even if he documented what had happened by writing it down, he still didn\'t believe anyone would still believe it. So the question remained. Was it be worth it to actually write it down?"},{"paragraph":"Her hair was a tangled mess which she tried to make presentable by putting in a lump on the top of her head. It didn\'t really work although it was a valiant attempt. While most people simply noticed the tangled mess on top of her head, what most people failed to understand that within the tangles mess was an entirely new year. That was her secret. She kept worlds on top of her head."},{"paragraph":"Twenty-five hours had passed since the incident. It seemed to be a lot longer than that. That twenty-five hours seemed more like a week in her mind. The fact that she still was having trouble comprehending exactly what took place wasn\'t helping the matter. She thought if she could just get a little rest the entire incident might make a little more sense."},{"paragraph":"The bowl was filled with fruit. It seemed to be an overabundance of strawberries, but it also included blueberries, raspberries, grapes, and banana slices. This was the meal Sarah had every morning to start her day since she could remember. Why she decided to add chocolate as an option today was still a bit of a surprise, but she had been in the process of deciding she wanted to change her routine. This was a baby step to begin that start."},{"paragraph":"Although Scott said it didn\'t matter to him, he knew deep inside that it did. They had been friends as long as he could remember and not once had he had to protest that something Joe apologized for doing didn\'t really matter. Scott stuck to his lie and insisted again and again that everything was fine as Joe continued to apologize. Scott already knew that despite his words accepting the apologies that their friendship would never be the same."},{"paragraph":"There was a time and a place for Stephanie to use her magic. The problem was that she had a difficult time determining this. She wished she could simply use it when the desire hit and there wouldn\'t be any unforeseen consequences. Unfortunately, that\'s not how it worked and the consequences could be devastating if she accidentally used her magic at the wrong time."},{"paragraph":"Devon couldn\'t figure out the color of her eyes. He initially would have guessed that they were green, but the more he looked at them he almost wanted to say they were a golden yellow. Then there were the flashes of red and orange that seemed to be streaked throughout them. It was almost as if her eyes were made of opal with the sun constantly glinting off of them and bringing out more color. They were definitely the most unusual pair of eyes he\'d ever seen."},{"paragraph":"How had she been so wrong? All her instincts and intuition completely failed her for the first time in her life. She had so heavily relied on both when making decisions up until this moment and she felt a seismic shift take place in her self-confidence. If she could be so completely wrong about something so simple as this, how could she make decisions about really important things taking place in her life? She wasn\'t sure what she should do next."},{"paragraph":"The trail to the left had a \'Danger! Do Not Pass\' sign telling people to take the trail to the right. This wasn\'t the way Zeke approached his hiking. Rather than a warning, Zeke read the sign as an invitation to explore an area that would be adventurous and exciting. As the others in the group all shited to the right, Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would later regret."},{"paragraph":"It all started with a random letter. Several of those were joined forces to create a random word. The words decided to get together and form a random sentence. They decided not to stop there and it wasn\'t long before a random paragraph had been cobbled together. The question was whether or not they could continue the momentum long enough to create a random short story."},{"paragraph":"The shades were closed keeping the room dark. Peter knew that he should open them and let in the sunlight so he could begin the day, but he didn\'t have the energy or willpower. Nothing had gone as expected the day before and he no longer wanted to spend the energy to begin a new day. He stared at the shades wondering if there was a way to disappear from the reality of the world for the rest of the day."},{"paragraph":"Her hand was balled into a fist with her keys protruding out from between her fingers. This was the weapon her father had shown her how to make when she walked alone to her car after work. She wished that she had something a little more potent than keys between her fingers. It would have been nice to have some mace or pepper spray. He had been meaning to buy some but had never gotten around to it. As the mother bear took another step forward with her cubs in tow, she knew her fist with keys wasn\'t going to be an adequate defense for this situation."},{"paragraph":"There was a time in his life when her rudeness would have set him over the edge. He would have raised his voice and demanded to speak to the manager. That was no longer the case. He barely reacted at all, letting the rudeness melt away without saying a word back to her. He had been around long enough to know where rudeness came from and how unhappy the person must be to act in that way. All he could do was feel pity and be happy that he didn\'t feel the way she did to lash out like that."},{"paragraph":"Betty decided to write a short story and she was sure it was going to be amazing. She had already written it in her head and each time she thought about it she grinned from ear to ear knowing how wonderful it would be. She could imagine the accolades coming in and the praise she would receive for creating such a wonderful piece. She was therefore extremely frustrated when she actually sat down to write the short story and the story that was so beautiful inside her head refused to come out that way on paper."},{"paragraph":"The red glow of tail lights indicating another long drive home from work after an even longer 24-hour shift at the hospital. The shift hadn\u2019t been horrible but the constant stream of patients entering the ER meant there was no downtime. She had some of the \u201cregulars\u201d in tonight with new ailments they were sure were going to kill them. It\u2019s amazing what a couple of Tylenol and a physical exam from the doctor did to eliminate their pain, nausea, headache, or whatever other mild symptoms they had. Sometimes she wondered if all they really needed was some interaction with others and a bit of the individual attention they received from the nurses."},{"paragraph":"The drug seekers would come into the emergency room and scream about how much pain they were in. When you told them that you would start elevating their pain with Tylenol or Advil instead of a narcotic they became nasty and combative. They would start telling you what drug and dose they had to have to make their pain tolerable. After dealing with the same drug seekers several times a month it gets old. Some of the doctors would give in and give them a dose of morphine and send them away. Sure that was faster, but ethically she still couldn\u2019t do it. Perhaps that\u2019s why she had longer care times than the other doctors."},{"paragraph":"He read about a hike called the incline in the guidebook. It said it was a strenuous hike and to bring plenty of water. \u201cA beautiful hike to the clouds\u201d described one review. \u201cNot for the faint-hearted,\u201d said another. \u201cNot too bad of a workout\u201d, bragged a third review. I thought I\u2019d hike it when I fly in from Maryland on my day off from the senior citizen\'s wellness conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so I could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a 70-year-old low-lander."},{"paragraph":"\u201cIngredients for life,\u201d said the backside of the truck. They mean food, but really food is only 1 ingredient of life. Life has so many more ingredients such as pain, happiness, laughter, joy, tears, and smiles. Life also has hard work, easy play, sleepless nights, and sunbathing by the ocean. Love, hatred, envy, self-assurance, and fear could be just down aisle 3 ready to be bought when needed. How I wish I could pull ingredients like these off shelves in a store."},{"paragraph":"What if dogs were racist? Would they care about fur color\u2026.. \u201cson, only play with other tan dogs\u201d? Or maybe it would depend on breed, \u201choney, only play with other German Shepards, never poodles\u201d. Better yet it could depend on occupation. \u201cI\u2019m a sled dog while you\u2019re only a running companion, leave me alone\u201d. Maybe the neighborhood they live in could be the way they choose which dogs to associate with and which to shun? Size could be the determining factor, \u201csee how tall that dog is, they are probably dumb\u201d. Luckily dogs don\u2019t discriminate. Just watch at a dog park. Big black and white dogs wag their tails and play with tiny tan dogs. A service dog chases after the same ball as the off-duty police dog. So if dogs don\u2019t discriminate then why do we?"},{"paragraph":"I checked in for the night at Out O The Way motel. What a bad choice that was. First I took a shower and a spider crawled out of the drain. Next, the towel rack fell down when I reached for the one small bath towel. This allowed the towel to fall halfway into the toilet. I tried to watch a movie, but the remote control was sticky and wouldn\u2019t stop scrolling through the channels. I gave up for the night and crawled into bed. I stretched out my leg and felt something furry by my foot. Filled with fear, I reached down and to my surprise, I pulled out a raccoon skin pair of underwear. After my initial relief that it wasn\u2019t alive, the image of a fat, ugly businessman wearing raccoon skin briefs filled my brain. I jumped out of the bed, threw my toothbrush into my bag, and sprinted towards my car."},{"paragraph":"There wasn\'t a whole lot he could do at that moment. He played the situation again and again in his head looking at what he might have done differently to make the situation better. No matter how many times he relived the situation in his head, there was never really a good alternative course of action. There simply wasn\'t a whole lot he could have done in that particular moment."},{"paragraph":"He heard the song coming from a distance, lightly floating over the air to his ears. Although it was soft and calming, he was wary. It seemed a little too soft and a little too calming for everything that was going on. He wanted it to be nothing more than beautiful music coming from the innocent and pure joy of singing, but in the back of his mind, he knew it was likely some type of trap."},{"paragraph":"No matter how hard he tried, he couldn\'t give her a good explanation about what had happened. It didn\'t even really make sense to him. All he knew was that he froze at the moment and no matter how hard he tried to react, nothing in his body allowed him to move. It was as if he had instantly become a statue and although he could see what was taking place, he couldn\'t move to intervene. He knew that wasn\'t a satisfactory explanation even though it was the truth."},{"paragraph":"The desert wind blew the tumbleweed in front of the car. Alex swerved to avoid the tumbleweed, but he turned the wheel a bit too strong and the car left the road and skidded onto the dirt median. He instantly slammed on the brakes and the car stopped in a cloud of dirt. When the dust cloud had settled and he could see around him again, he realized that he\'d somehow crossed over into an entirely new dimension."},{"paragraph":"He hid under the covers hoping that nobody would notice him there. It really didn\'t make much sense since it would be obvious to anyone who walked into the room there was someone hiding there, but he still held out hope. He heard footsteps coming down the hall and stop in front in front of the bedroom door. He heard the squeak of the door hinges and someone opened the bedroom door. He held his breath waiting for whoever was about to discover him, but they never did."},{"paragraph":"They decided to find the end of the rainbow. While they hoped they would find a pot of gold, neither of them truly believed that the mythical pot would actually be there. Nor did they believe they could actually find the end of the rainbow. Still, it seemed like a fun activity for the day, and pictures of them chasing rainbows would look great on their Instagram accounts. They would have never believed they would actually find the end of a rainbow, and when they did, what they actually found there."},{"paragraph":"Sarah watched the whirlpool mesmerized. She couldn\'t take her eyes off the water swirling around and around. She stuck in small twigs and leaves to watch the whirlpool catch them and then suck them down. It bothered her more than a little bit that this could also be used as a metaphor for her life."},{"paragraph":"Patrick didn\'t want to go. The fact that she was insisting they must go made him want to go even less. He had no desire to make small talk with strangers he would never again see just to be polite. But she insisted that Patrick go, and she would soon find out that this would be the biggest mistake she could make in their relationship."},{"paragraph":"It was always the Monday mornings. It never seemed to happen on Tuesday morning, Wednesday morning, or any other morning during the week. But it happened every Monday morning like clockwork. He mentally prepared himself to once again deal with what was about to happen, but this time he also placed a knife in his pocket just in case."},{"paragraph":"\'Can I get you anything else?\' David asked. It was a question he asked a hundred times a day and he always received the same answer. It had become such an ingrained part of his daily routine that he had to step back and actively think when he heard the little girl\'s reply. Nobody had before answered the question the way that she did, and David didn\'t know how he should respond."},{"paragraph":"The time had come for Nancy to say goodbye. She had been dreading this moment for a good six months, and it had finally arrived despite her best efforts to forestall it. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn\'t keep the inevitable from happening. So the time had come for a normal person to say goodbye and move on. It was at this moment that Nancy decided not to be a normal person. After all the time and effort she had expended, she couldn\'t bring herself to do it."},{"paragraph":"There were a variety of ways to win the game. James had played it long enough to know most of them and he could see what his opponent was trying to do. There was a simple counterattack that James could use and the game should be his. He began deploying it with the confidence of a veteran player who had been in this situation a thousand times in the past. So, it was with great surprise when his opponent used a move he had never before seen or anticipated to easily defeat him in the game."},{"paragraph":"She was infatuated with color. She didn\'t have a favorite color per se, but she did have a fondness for teals and sea greens. You could see it in the clothes she wore that color was an important part of her overall style. She took great pride that color flowed from her and that color was always all around her. That is why, she explained to her date sitting across the table, that she could never have a serious relationship with him due to the fact that he was colorblind."},{"paragraph":"He scolded himself for being so tentative. He knew he shouldn\'t be so cautious, but there was a sixth sense telling him that things weren\'t exactly as they appeared. It was that weird chill that rolls up your neck and makes the hair stand on end. He knew that being so tentative could end up costing him the job, but he learned that listening to his sixth sense usually kept him from getting into a lot of trouble."},{"paragraph":"With six children in tow, Catherine raced to the airport departing gate. This wasn\'t an easy task as the children had other priorities than to get to the gate. She knew that she was tight on time and the frustration came out as she yelled at the kids to keep up. They continued to test her, pretending not to listen and to move in directions that only slowed them down. They had no idea the wrath they were about to receive when Catherine made it to the gate only to be informed that they had all missed the plane."},{"paragraph":"Was it a whisper or was it the wind? He wasn\'t quite sure. He thought he heard a voice but at this moment all he could hear was the wind rustling the leaves of the trees all around him. He stopped and listened more intently to see if he could hear the voice again. Nothing but the wind rustling the leaves could be heard. He was about to continue his walk when he felt a hand on his shoulder, and he quickly turned to see who it was. There was nobody there, but he heard the voice again."},{"paragraph":"It had been a late night. To be more correct, it had been an early morning. It was now 3:00 AM and George was just getting home. He wasn\'t sure if it had been worth it. He was supposed to have been finished by 10:00 PM, but his boss had implored him to stay and help when it was clear they weren\'t going to meet the 10:00 PM target time. So, he had stayed an extra 5 hours and lost a good night\'s sleep for something he didn\'t really believe in, but he did anyway because he was afraid if he refused he might lose his job."},{"paragraph":"The rain was coming. Everyone thought this would be a good thing. It hadn\'t rained in months and the earth was dry as a bone. It wasn\'t a surprise that everyone thought a good rain was what was needed, but they never expected how much rain would actually arrive."},{"paragraph":"It had been a rough day. Things hadn\'t gone as planned and that meant Hannah got yelled at by her boss. It didn\'t even matter that it wasn\'t her fault. When things went wrong at work, Hannah got the blame no matter the actual circumstances. It wasn\'t fair, but there was little she could do without risking her job, and she wasn\'t in a position to do that with the plans she had."},{"paragraph":"There was a leak in the boat. Nobody had yet noticed it, and nobody would for the next couple of hours. This was a problem since the boat was heading out to sea and while the leak was quite small at the moment, it would be much larger when it was ultimately discovered. John had planned it exactly this way."},{"paragraph":"It was a good idea. At least, they all thought it was a good idea at the time. Hindsight would reveal that in reality, it was an unbelievably terrible idea, but it would take another week for them to understand that. Right now, at this very moment. they all agreed that it was the perfect course of action for the current situation."},{"paragraph":"It wasn\'t that he hated her. It was simply that he didn\'t like her much. It was difficult for him to explain this to her, and even more difficult for her to truly understand. She was in love and wanted him to feel the same way. He didn\'t, and no matter how he tried to explain to her she refused to listen or to understand."},{"paragraph":"The answer was within her reach. It was hidden in a box and now that box sat directly in front of her. She\'d spent years searching for it and could hardly believe she\'d finally managed to find it. She turned the key to unlock the box and then gently lifted the top. She held her breath in anticipation of finally knowing the answer she had spent so much of her time in search of. As the lid came off she could see that the box was empty."},{"paragraph":"The light blinded him. It was dark and he thought he was the only one in the area, but the light shining in his eyes proved him wrong. It came from about 100 feet away and was shining so directly into his eyes he couldn\'t make out anything about the person holding the light. There was only one thing to do in this situation. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a flashlight of his own that was much stronger than the one currently blinding him. He turned it on and pointed it into the stranger\'s eyes."},{"paragraph":"The kids were loud. They were way too loud for Jerry, especially since this was a four-hour flight. The parents didn\'t seem to be able, or simply didn\'t want, to control them. They were yelling and fighting among themselves and it was impossible for any of the passengers to concentrate or rest. He thought about politely tapping on the parents\' shoulders and asking them to try and get their kids under a bit more control, but before he did he came up with a better idea. Sure, it was a bit sinister, and he\'d probably end p in a lot of trouble, but he really didn\'t care at that point."},{"paragraph":"Nobody really understood Kevin. It wasn\'t that he was super strange or difficult. It was more that there wasn\'t enough there that anyone wanted to take the time to understand him. This was a shame as Kevin had many of the answers to the important questions most people who knew him had. It was even more of a shame that they\'d refuse to listen even if Kevin offered to give them the answers. So, Kevin remained silent, misunderstood, and kept those important answers to life to himself."},{"paragraph":"He was after the truth. At least, that\'s what he told himself. He believed it, but any rational person on the outside could see he was lying to himself. It was apparent he was really only after his own truth that he\'d already decided and was after this truth because the facts didn\'t line up with the truth he wanted. So he continued to tell everyone he was after the truth oblivious to the real truth sitting right in front of him."},{"paragraph":"To the two friends, the treehouse was much more than a treehouse. It was a sanctuary away from the other kids where they could be themselves without being teased or bullied. It was their secret fortress hidden high in the branches of a huge oak that only they knew existed. At least that is what they thought. They were more than a little annoyed when their two younger sisters decided to turn the treehouse into a princess castle by painting the inside pink and putting glitter everywhere."},{"paragraph":"The time to take action was now. All three men knew in their hearts this was the case, yet none of them moved a muscle to try. They were all watching and waiting for one of the others to make the first move so they could follow a step or two behind and help. The situation demanded a leader and all three men were followers."},{"paragraph":"There had to be a better way. That\'s all Nancy could think as she sat at her desk staring at her computer screen. She\'d already spent five years of her life in this little cubicle staring at her computer doing \'work\' that didn\'t seem to matter to anyone including her own boss. There had to be more to her life than this and there had to be a better way to make a living. That\'s what she was thinking when the earthquake struck."},{"paragraph":"She put the pen to paper but she couldn\'t bring herself to actually write anything. She just stared at the blank card and wondered what words she could write that would help in even a small way. She thought of a dozen ways to begin but none seemed to do justice to the situation. There were no words that could help and she knew it."},{"paragraph":"There weren\'t supposed to be dragons flying in the sky. First and foremost, dragons didn\'t exist. They were mythical creatures from fantasy books like unicorns. This was something that Pete knew in his heart to be true so he was having a difficult time acknowledging that there were actually fire-breathing dragons flying in the sky above him."},{"paragraph":"Rhonda prided herself on always taking the path less traveled. She\'d decided to do this at an early age and had continued to do so throughout her entire life. It was a point of pride and she would explain to anyone who would listen that doing so was something that she\'d made great efforts to always do. She\'d never questioned this decision until her five-year-old niece asked her, \'So, is this why your life has been so difficult?\' and Rhonda didn\'t have an answer for her."},{"paragraph":"Finding the red rose in the mailbox was a pleasant surprise for Sarah. She didn\'t have a boyfriend or know of anyone who was interested in her as anything more than a friend. There wasn\'t even a note attached to it. Although it was a complete mystery, it still made her heart jump and race a little more than usual. She wished that she could simply accept the gesture and be content knowing someone had given it to her, but that wasn\'t the way Sarah did things. Now it was time to do a little detective work and try to figure who had actually left the red rose."},{"paragraph":"It was the first day of the rest of her life. This wasn\'t the day she was actually born, but she knew that nothing would be the same from this day forward. Although this was a bit scary to her, it was also extremely freeing. Her past was no longer a burden or something that she needed to be concerned about and defend. She threw off the covers keeping her warm in bed, placed her feet over the side of the bed, slipped on her slipper, and took the first step of the first day of her new life."},{"paragraph":"What were the chances? It would have to be a lot more than 100 to 1. It was likely even more than 1,000 to 1. The more he thought about it, the odds of it happening had to be more than 10,000 to 1 and even 100,000 to 1. People often threw around the chances of something happening as being 1,000,000 to 1 as an exaggeration of an unlikely event, but he could see that they may actually be accurate in this situation. Whatever the odds of it happening, he knew they were big. What he didn\'t know was whether this happening was lucky or unlucky."},{"paragraph":"Wandering down the path to the pond had become a daily routine. Even when the weather wasn\'t cooperating like today with the wind and rain, Jerry still took the morning stroll down the path until he reached the pond. Although there didn\'t seem to be a particular reason Jerry did this to anyone looking in from the outside, those who knew him well knew exactly what was going on. It could all be traced back to a specific incident that happened exactly 5 years previously."},{"paragraph":"Lori lived her life through the lens of a camera. She never realized this until this very moment as she scrolled through thousands of images on your computer. She could remember the exact moment each photo was taken. She could remember where she had been, what she was thinking as she tried to get the shot, the smells of the surrounding area, and even the emotions that she felt taking the photo, yet she had trouble remembering what she had for breakfast."},{"paragraph":"There was a time when this wouldn\'t have bothered her. The fact that it did actually bother her bothered her even more. What had changed in her life that such a small thing could annoy her so much for the entire day? She knew it was ridiculous that she even took notice of it, yet she was still obsessing over it as she tried to fall asleep."},{"paragraph":"Life isn\'t always beautiful. That was a lesson that Dan was learning. He also realized that life wasn\'t easy. This had come as a shock since he had lived a charmed life. He hated that this was the truth and he struggled to be happy knowing that his assumptions weren\'t correct. He wouldn\'t realize until much later in life that the difficult obstacles he was facing that were taking away the beauty in his life at this moment would ultimately make his life much more beautiful. All he knew was that at this moment was that life isn\'t always beautiful."},{"paragraph":"Mary had to make a decision and she knew that whatever decision she made, it would upset someone. It seemed like such a silly reason for people to get upset but she knew the minute that she began to consider doing it that there was no way everyone in her life would be pleased with what she ultimately decided to do. It was simply a question of who she would rather displease most. While this had always been her parents, and especially her mom, in the past that she tried to keep from upsetting, she decided that this time the person she was going to please the most with her decision was herself."},{"paragraph":"He had disappointed himself more than anyone else. That wasn\'t to say that he hadn\'t disappointed others. The fact was that he had disappointed a lot of people who were close to him. The fact that they were disappointed in him was something that made him even more disappointed in himself. Yet here he was, about to do the exact same things that had caused all the disappointment in the first place because he didn\'t know what else to do."},{"paragraph":"They told her that this was her once chance to show the world what she was made of. She believed them at the time. It was the big stage and she knew the world would be there to see. The only one who had disagreed with this sentiment was her brother. He had told her that you don\'t show the world what you\'re made of when they are all watching, you show that in your actions when nobody was looking. It was looking more and more like her brother was correct."},{"paragraph":"The water rush down the wash and into the slot canyon below. Two hikers had started the day to sunny weather without a cloud in the sky, but they hadn\'t thought to check the weather north of the canyon. Huge thunderstorms had brought a deluge o rain and produced flash floods heading their way. The two hikers had no idea what was coming."},{"paragraph":"The piano sat silently in the corner of the room. Nobody could remember the last time it had been played. The little girl walked up to it and hit a few of the keys. The sound of the piano rang throughout the house for the first time in years. In the upstairs room, confined to her bed, the owner of the house had tears in her eyes."},{"paragraph":"It was a simple green chair. There was nothing extraordinary about it or so it seemed. It was the type of chair one would pass without even noticing it was there, let alone what the actual color of it was. It was due to this common and unassuming appearance that few people actually stopped to sit in it and discover its magical powers."},{"paragraph":"The fog was as thick as pea soup. This was a problem. Gary was driving but couldn\'t see a thing in front of him. He knew he should stop, but the road was narrow so if he did, it would be right in the center of the road. He was sure that another car would end up rear-ending him, so he continued forward despite the lack of visibility. This was an unwise move."},{"paragraph":"He stared out the window at the snowy field. He\'d been stuck in the house for close to a month and his only view of the outside world was through the window. There wasn\'t much to see. It was mostly just the field with an occasional bird or small animal who ventured into the field. As he continued to stare out the window, he wondered how much longer he\'d be shackled to the steel bar inside the house."},{"paragraph":"Frank knew there was a correct time and place to reveal his secret and this wasn\'t it. The issue was that the secret might be revealed despite his best attempt to keep it from coming out. At this point, it was out of his control and completely dependant on those around him who also knew the secret. They wouldn\'t purposely reveal it, or at least he believed that, but they could easily inadvertently expose it. It was going to be a long hour as he nervously eyed everyone around the table hoping they would keep their mouths shut."},{"paragraph":"\'So, what do you think?\' he asked nervously. He wanted to know the answer, but at the same time, he didn\'t. He\'d put his heart and soul into the project and he wasn\'t sure he\'d be able to recover if they didn\'t like what he produced. The silence from the others in the room seemed to last a lifetime even though it had only been a moment since he asked the question. \'So, what do you think?\' he asked again."},{"paragraph":"It really doesn\'t matter what she thinks as it isn\'t her problem to solve. That\'s what he kept trying to convince himself. She was trying to insert her opinion where it wasn\'t wanted or welcome. He already had a plan and even though that plan didn\'t correspond with what she wanted him to do or what should be done, it wasn\'t her decision to make. The question now became whether he would stick to his convictions and go through with his plan knowing she wouldn\'t approve."},{"paragraph":"It was cloudy outside but not really raining. There was a light sprinkle at most and there certainly wasn\'t a need for an umbrella. This hadn\'t stopped Sarah from pulling her umbrella out and opening it. It had nothing to do with the weather or the potential rain later that day. Sarah used the umbrella to hide."},{"paragraph":"It was supposed to be a dream vacation. They had planned it over a year in advance so that it would be perfect in every way. It had been what they had been looking forward to through all the turmoil and negativity around them. It had been the light at the end of both their tunnels. Now that the dream vacation was only a week away, the virus had stopped all air travel."},{"paragraph":"Brock would have never dared to do it on his own he thought to himself. That is why Kenneth and he had become such good friends. Kenneth forced Brock out of his comfort zone and made him try new things he\'d never imagine doing otherwise. Up to this point, this had been a good thing. It had expanded Brock\'s experiences and given him a new appreciation for life. Now that both of them were in the back of a police car, all Brock could think was that he would have never dared do it except for the influence of Kenneth."},{"paragraph":"They needed to find a place to eat. The kids were beginning to get grumpy in the back seat and if they didn\'t find them food soon, it was just a matter of time before they were faced with a complete meltdown. Even knowing this, the solution wasn\'t easy. Everyone in the car had a different opinion on where the best place to eat would be with nobody agreeing with the suggestions of the others. It seemed to be an impossible no-win situation where not everyone would be happy no matter where they decided to eat which in itself would lead to a meltdown. Yet a decision needed to be made and it needed to be made quickly."},{"paragraph":"The bridge spanning a 100-foot gully stood in front of him as the last obstacle blocking him from reaching his destination. While people may have called it a \'bridge\', the reality was it was nothing more than splintered wooden planks held together by rotting ropes. It was questionable whether it would hold the weight of a child, let alone the weight of a grown man. The problem was there was no other way across the gully, and this played into his calculations of whether or not it was worth the risk of trying to cross it."},{"paragraph":"The tree missed the days the kids used to come by and play. It still wore the tire swing the kids had put up in its branches years ago although both the tire and the rope had seen better days. The tree had watched all the kids in the neighborhood grow up and leave, and it wondered if there would ever be a time when another child played and laughed again under its branches. That was the hope that the tree wished every day as the swing gently swung empty in the wind."},{"paragraph":"The irony of the situation hadn\'t escaped her. She had taken years to sculpt the perfect persona with the perfect look that she shared on Instagram. She knew her hundreds of thousands of followers envied that life she showed and stayed engaged with her because they wanted that life too. The truth was that she wanted the perfect life she portrayed more than any of her fans. The fact was that despite all the perfection she shared on social media, her life was actually more of a mess than most."},{"paragraph":"It was the best compliment that he\'d ever received although the person who gave it likely never knew. It had been an off-hand observation on his ability to hold a conversation and actually add pertinent information to it on practically any topic. Although he hadn\'t consciously strived to be able to do so, he\'d started to voraciously read the news when he couldn\'t keep up on topics his friends discussed because their conversations went above his head. The fact that someone had noticed enough to compliment him that he could talk intelligently about many topics meant that he had succeeded in his quest to be better informed."},{"paragraph":"A two-inch layer of freshly fallen snow covered the yard. Stacey peeked outside. To most, it would have been a beautiful sight worthy of taking a photo to put on Instagram. For Stacey, it meant something different. The first snow of the year brought back the witches as the fairies in the yard had to seek shelter to avoid the cold."},{"paragraph":"One foot in front of the other, One more step, and then one more. Jack\'s only thoughts were to keep moving no matter how much his body screamed to stop and rest. He\'s lost almost all his energy and his entire body ached beyond belief, but he forced himself to take another step. Then another. And then one more."},{"paragraph":"Brenda never wanted to be famous. While most of her friends dreamed about being famous, she could see the negative aspects that those who wanted to be famous seemed to ignore. The fact that you could never do anything in public without being mobbed and the complete lack of privacy was something that she never wanted to experience. She also had no desire to have strangers speculating about every aspect of her life and what each thing she did was supposed to mean. Brenda was perfectly happy with her anonymous life where she could do exactly as she wanted without anyone else giving a damn. Thus, her overnight Internet celebrity was not something she was thrilled about as her friends told her how lucky she was."},{"paragraph":"There was no ring on his finger. That was a good sign although far from proof that he was available. Still, it was much better than if he had been wearing a wedding ring on his hand. She glanced at his hand a bit more intently to see if there were any tan lines where a ring may have been, and he\'s simply taken it off. She couldn\'t detect any which was also a good sign and a relief. The next step would be to get access to his wallet to see if there were any family photos in it."},{"paragraph":"They had no proof. He knew that they knew he had done it but they didn\'t have any proof. It was a huge distinction and it was the difference between him keeping his freedom or being locked away for decades.
